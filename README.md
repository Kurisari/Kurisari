Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m currently an Artificial Intelligence Engineering student at Universidad Panamericana, Campus Aguascalientes. My main playgrounds are Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, and C++â€”but Python is my go-to language.

I love working on AI projects, especially things like my MX-Banknote-Recognition project and anything that lets me dive deeper into the world of artificial intelligence.

Outside of coding, youâ€™ll probably find me strumming my guitar, kicking a soccer ball around, or out and about with my camera. If you want to know more or just connect, check me out on LinkedIn or visit my website.

Letâ€™s build something cool together! ðŸš€
